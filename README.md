## Troubleshooting

If you have issues, please check the following first:
* Does this happen in browser?
* Does this happen in [the original app?](https://github.com/revoltchat/desktop)
* Are you using an outdated version?
* If you have connection problems, do you have a firewall?

If all of the above is false, and it's not listed in the known bugs, please [report an issue.](https://github.com/ggtylerr/divolt-desktop/issues/new/choose)

## Known bugs

* Unable to preload CSS

This shouldn't happen anymore, but if it does, right click the tray icon and hit "clear cache".

* App auto-updated to normal Revolt

***Please make sure you downloaded the latest version!*** Most people have downloaded the initial release, and the one immediately after that fixed it.

You can check what version you had by looking in your downloads / history. If you downloaded before May 22, 2022, or downloaded 1.0.4 (also known as v1.0.4-d1.0.0, or any of the automated builds before that,) then you were using an outdated version.

If this still occurred on a later version, please report an issue.
